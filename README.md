## Overview

The Calculator app that allows users to perform mathematical calculations that can be accessed through a web browser and is compatible with keyboard input.

The interface is designed to be user-friendly, featuring a keypad for inputting numbers and buttons for performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

Additionally, users can enter numbers and operations directly using their keyboard, providing an alternative input method for those who prefer it.
## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operators** - This feature includes the basic arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operators enable the user to perform basic mathematical calculations using the calculator.

* **Clear** - This feature clears the current input on the calculator's display, allowing the user to start a new calculation.

* **Backspace** - This feature enables the user to remove the last input digit from the calculator's display. This is useful if the user accidentally enters an incorrect digit or wants to correct a mistake.

* **Decimal Point** - This feature allows the user to enter decimal numbers into the calculator's display, which is essential for performing more advanced calculations.

* **Error Handling** - This feature includes error handling for two scenarios:
    
    **a. Division by Zero** - If the user tries to divide a number by zero, the calculator displays an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

    **b. Number is too large:** If the user enters a number that is too large to be calculated by the calculator, the calculator displays an error message indicating that the number is too large.

## Tools

* Visual Studio Code
* Gitbash terminal
* Git and GitHub
